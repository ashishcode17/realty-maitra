  ✅ ALL BUILD ERRORS FIXED!
================================================================================

I deleted all duplicate pages that were causing build errors:

✅ Deleted: app/dashboard/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/income/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/network/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/offers/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/projects/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/projects/[id]/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/training/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/admin/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/leads/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/notifications/page.tsx
✅ Deleted: app/settings/page.tsx

All these pages now only exist in:
app/(authenticated)/

This is correct because they all require login!

================================================================================
  🚀 NEXT STEP: Set Up Database
================================================================================

The build errors are fixed! Now you just need to:

1. Get a free database from https://neon.tech
2. Update .env file with the connection string
3. Run SETUP_DATABASE.bat
4. Run START.bat

See STEP_BY_STEP.txt for detailed instructions!
